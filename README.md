### Eagler Velocity Template

this is a template velocity server with eaglercraft support. It also has nlogin and limbo setup, so its a good base if you're trying to self host a network. you can replace dionysus with whatever version you want, i just chose dionysus because it has really good performance for 1.12.2 anarchy servers which a good amount of people are trying to run for school servers. 


#### Forwarding

If you're trying to self host but have no idea what you're doing, i recommend installing tailscale on the device youre selfhosting with, then running funnel on it so it can access the internet without having to port forward. https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel
